Endless Runner with a twist. Roll your bulky cube down a procedurally generated path and beat the highscore or a friend in a Split Screen Mode. 

Use Jump- and Speed-Pads to get around and gain extra points for going super fast all while avoiding mines deployed on the track.

Little game project of a friend and me. Created at the Harz University of Applied Sciences.
